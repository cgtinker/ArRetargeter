# ArRetargeter

This branch includes my thesis results.

This app saves the ar pose estimated data of the camera pose / face into a .json file. The .json can be imported into 
blender to retrive the camera motion / face mesh.


The app currently includes three plugins:
NatCorder
NativeGallery
NativeShare

Currently the app is in development. You can download and build the app, the received .json can be used in any way, even commercially. However you currently aren't allowed to modify or sell the app.
